# Brightness-control-for-Raspberry-Pi-7-Inch-Touch-Screen-Display


How to control the original 7 inch display of the Raspberry Pi with a photoresistor. The photoresistor is integrated directly into the display through a small modification and makes it possible to adjust the brightness of the display to the ambient brightness. This can be particularly useful if you are using the display in an environment where the brightness often varies.
